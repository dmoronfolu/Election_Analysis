# Election_Analysis

PyPoll Challenge


Overview of Project

The purpose of this assignment is to code and run the data for the election results. The election committee has requested that the Voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count and the county with the highest turnout be included in the election audit conducted by Tom and Seth. The goal of this challenge is to help Seth and Tom get those data for the committee. 

Results

I was able to get the total votes result for the election, but unfortunately was unable to get the correct accurate results for the candidates and individual counties. I worked on this for hours but I believe some of my codes are incorrect. I plan to continue practicing until I get the desired result and will attempt to resubmit if I become successful before the deadline. The total votes in this election was 369, 711. I was able to cross check my answer with the module and discovered that it was accurate. Unfortunately, I didn’t get the accurate result for the others. 

 

**Please note that the above image was from the Module 3 Challenge results in the bootcampspot website. 

According to the module, the following is the breakdown of the county votes: 
	Jefferson County: 10% (38,855 votes) 
	Denver County:  82.8% (306,892 votes) 
	Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801 votes)

Based on this results, Denver had the largest county turnover. 

There were three candidates for this election: Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette and Raymon Anthony Doane. The election result is listed below: 

	Diana DeGette had the highest vote with 272, 892. 
	Charles Casper Stockham was the runner up with 85, 213 votes 
	Raymon Anthony Doane had the least amount of votes with 11, 606 votes. 



Summary

We can conclude from the election results that Denver had the most turnover and this can be advantageous to the election committee for future elections. Jefferson had more votes than Arapahoe but their numbers are closer to each other than Denver. Denver could have more population than the other two counties, which would explain the large turnover.
